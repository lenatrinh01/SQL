#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 
#RDBMS used: SQLite Studio


#1. Display data from customer table and clean any “messy” data.
SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.customers
WHERE length(order_id)=6
AND order_id<> 'Order ID'
;

#2. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderid) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales\
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> ''
;

#3. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> ''
;

#4. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderID
WHERE length(order_id) = 6
AND order_id <> 'Order ID'
;

#5. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

#6. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)*price AS totalRevenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
;

#7. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product
, SUM(Quantity)
, SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product
;

#8. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cust.acctnum)
, AVG(Quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderid = cust.order_id
WHERE Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
;
